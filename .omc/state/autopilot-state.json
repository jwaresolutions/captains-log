  "original_prompt": "autopilot: this code is buggy, please fix it. for example, there should be a system that pushes changes to the android app when i make changes in the web app and visaversa, but that is not workig. when i click on the alerts tab in the webpage i get a system error, on the app in settings i get an error \"missing bluetooth permissions\" i am sure there are a bunch of other things wrong with this codebase. please use the docs in the .kiro folder to get an idea of what this app should do and then pick through the code and fix problems, remove code that does nothing, merge code that appears to be needlessly replicated and write unit tests making sure to analyze any part of the code that cant be excersized anymore. please start an analysis and ask me questions before you begin.",
